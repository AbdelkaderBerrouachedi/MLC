# Deep Ensemble Methods for Multi-label Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of:
- **Deep ExtraTrees for Multi-label Classification (DET)**
- **Deep Parallel ExtraTrees for Multi-label Classification**

Novel layered ensemble frameworks that bridge the gap between traditional tree-based methods and deep learning architectures for multi-label classification tasks.

## Features
- **Deep ExtraTrees (DET)**: Hierarchical ensemble architecture with prediction augmentation
- **Multi-strategy Support**: Integration with Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset
- **Computational Efficiency**: Deep learning performance with traditional method efficiency
- **Interpretability**: Maintains tree-based model transparency

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn >= 1.0
